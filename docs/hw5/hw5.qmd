## Exercise 2
A.

![THIS... is an elephant.](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/elephant.png){width=40%}


B. I could see 2 arguments, first it is a collection of line marks, the second is you could argue this is a very fancy text mark, because how different graphic wise is an image and a letter. There is also the text description which is definitely a text mark. This graphic doesn't really have any variables mapped, it is a collection of lines that is meant to create a pattern we recognize as an elephant.

C. The story is the showcase of what an elephant looks like.

D. It successfully evokes a connotation with elephants immediately when we look at it.

E. I already know how to add the text mark into the graphic.

F. Yes, without having any clear idea of how data is mapped, I do not know how to create line mark segments (except if you created a data set with enough points of purely x,y data that it blends into a line when you see it visualized).

## Exercise 3

#### graphic 1:

```{r}
'
{
  "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v6.json",
  "description": "Seattle Weather by month",
  "data": {"url": "https://calvin-data304.netlify.app/data/weather-with-dates.csv"},
  "mark": "line",
  "width": "800",
  "title": "Mean max Temparture in Seatle by Month",
  "encoding": { 
    "x": {"field": "month", "type": "temporal", "axis": {"labelAngle": 0, "format": "%B"}},
    "y": {"field": "temp_max", "type": "quantitative", "aggregate": "mean", "title": "mean max temp"},
    "color": {"field": "year"}
  }
}' |> as_vegaspec()
```

For this graph I have chosen to display 12 months since I have separated the years by color, you could recreate this graph using the full date column and end up with 48 months (12 months x 4 years of data) and 1 long line.

#### graphic 2:

```{r}
'
{
  "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v6.json",
  "description": "Seattle Weather by month",
  "data": {"url": "https://calvin-data304.netlify.app/data/weather-with-dates.csv"},
  "mark": "bar",
  "width": "800",
  "title": "Weather Types by Month in Seattle, WA Over 4 Years",
  "encoding": { 
    "x": {
      "field": "month", 
      "type": "nominal", 
      "timeUnit": "month",
      "axis": {"labelAngle": 0, "format": "%B"}
    },
    "xOffset": {"field":"weather"},
    "detail": {"field": "year"},
    "y": {
      "field": "weather", 
      "type": "quantitative", 
      "aggregate": "count", 
      "title": "# of Days"
    },
    "color": {"field": "weather"}
  }
}' |> as_vegaspec()
```

The graphic here shows that the sunniest month in Seattle over these 4 years is August and the Rainiest month is December.
